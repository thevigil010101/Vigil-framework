                    <h3>Carl Jung</h3>
                    <p>Shadow work, individuation, alchemy. <em>"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate."</em></p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>Jordan Peterson</h3>
                    <p>Personal responsibility. Clean your beach before calling waves.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>Maynard James Keenan (Tool & A Perfect Circle)</h3>
                    <p>Tool made shadow work powerful. Been doing God's work for 30+ years. APC taught me to be real about addictions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>James Hetfield & Metallica</h3>
                    <p>Showed millions you can feel everything and still be strong. St. Anger proved what happens when you drop metaphor—society rejects direct truth.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>System of a Down</h3>
                    <p>Made political consciousness visceral. Showed systems at low VC.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>Gojira</h3>
                    <p>Death acceptance, environmental consciousness, indigenous wisdom. They feel the species crisis.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>Baroness & John Baizley</h3>
                    <p>Their full catalogue got me through my toughest times. Showed me beauty exists within chaos, not after it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>Coheed and Cambria</h3>
                    <p>Emotional honesty through metaphor. Highly inspirational.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>Damien Rice</h3>
                    <p>Raw vulnerability, quiet shadow work.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>Ryan Adams</h3>
                    <p>Showed you can be productive while integrating—if output is honest.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>Ghost</h3>
                    <p>Made shadow work playful. Taught me about binary. Proved consciousness work can be fun.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>Mastodon</h3>
                    <p>Everything. 30 years of endless integration made audible. Taught me grief doesn't resolve—it integrates.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>Brent "Dirty B" Hinds - Rest In Peace</h3>
                    <p>Pure flow of consciousness made person. One of my biggest inspirations. Thank you for showing us what it looks like to live without cement.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>Cliff Burton - Rest In Peace</h3>
                    <p>Metallica's soul. Classical training meeting metal created the foundation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>Chester Bennington - Rest In Peace</h3>
                    <p>Made pain visible. His death is why this work matters. We failed him collectively. This framework is too late for Chester. It's not too late for the next person at VC = 15.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>Pink Floyd</h3>
                    <p><em>The Wall</em> = cement made literal. They showed what happens when you build walls instead of beach.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>Eminem</h3>
                    <p>Raw vulnerability through rage. Showed you can be masculine AND broken.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>Prof</h3>
                    <p>Eccentric, unapologetic energy. Plays with duality: funny but hurting, confident but vulnerable. Taught me you can be both. You don't have to pick.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="acknowledgment">
                    <h3>Russian Circles</h3>
                    <p><strong>Maybe the biggest one.</strong> No language. No words. Pure consciousness expansion. They give you the set and setting to process your own experience. Album progression: <em>Enter → Station → Empros → Memorial → Guidance → Blood Year → Gnosis → Satellite</em>. Each title tells you the container. The experience inside is YOURS.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="final-gratitude">
                    <h2>To All of Them:</h2>
                    <p>You transmitted consciousness work in ways that reached subconscious when direct truth couldn't be heard. You found effective methods to get truth past defenses.</p>
                    <p><strong>Thank you for doing the work publicly. Thank you for not suppressing. If this framework helps anyone, you helped first.</strong></p>
